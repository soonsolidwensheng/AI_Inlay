# AI Inlay Generation
This is the code base for generation and post processing algorithms that design a Inlay mesh from AI predictions.  

## Implemented   
- [x] Adjustable cement gap spacing  
- [x] Adjustable stitching distance
- [x] Adjustable distance to the margin that do not get deformed by adaptations  
- [x] Adjustable distance to the margin that get deformed by adaptations  
- [x] Adjustable insertion depth of adaptations  
- [x] Adjustable distance to the margin that do not get inflated by min thickness    
- [x] Min thickness with better anotomy after inflation   
- [x] Support for Adjustable min thickness   
- [x] A robust min thickness algo that does not stop working occasionally   
- [x] Refactoring of the workflow to benefit from more dental prior knowledge  
- [x] Better margin adaptation so that the stitching looks better   
- [x] Redesign of the approximal adaptation algorithm    
- [x] WebUI deployment    
## Under Development
- [ ] Robust collision detection in occlusal adaptation
## TODOs
- [ ] Studio handoff
